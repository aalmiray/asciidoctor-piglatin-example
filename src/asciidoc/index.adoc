Pig Latin is a constructed language game where words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules. Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an _ay_ (IPA [eÉª]) (for example, _pig_ yields _igpay_, _banana_ yields _ananabay_, and _trash_ yields _ashtray_). Also in the Northeastern United States many people only move the first letter not the first syllable so 'trash' yields 'rashtay'.

The objective is to conceal the meaning of the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a "strange and foreign-sounding language."
